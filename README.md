Music Popularity Database System
The major problem many artists face is the overwhelming problem that listeners aren’t interested in their songs or don’t like them or their music videos and then the song turns out to be a flop song/album which is a major setback for many artists. By getting the above information about the trending songs/albums then the artists and their teams can make the necessary decision and changes to the songs or albums they are set to release to make them fit the trending type of music to make the chances of the song becoming a hit very high hence increasing their views and streams exponentially. (E.g.: If an artist is to release a new single, they can alter the
tempo and energy of the song to be similar to the hit songs of the current era and hence increase the chances of their songs becoming a hit).
